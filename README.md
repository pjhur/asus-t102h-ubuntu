Setup Guide for Asus Transformer Mini (T102H) and Ubuntu Cinnamon

### Hardware Specifications
[https://www.asus.com/us/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS-Transformer-Mini-T102HA/specifications/](https://www.asus.com/us/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS-Transformer-Mini-T102HA/specifications/) My computer has "Model:T102H" written on the back but nearly all online sources state the model number as T102HA.

### Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix 19.10
Download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntu-cinnamon-remix/). I used cinnamonremix-19.10-all.20191204.iso
while writing this guide. Please note this is not an official Ubuntu flavour.

### Status Out of Box
Mostly works with the exception of the webcam. Since this computer was released in October 2016, I would expect the hardware 
support in Ubuntu 19.10 to be very good.
Wifi: Works
Sound: Works
Bluetooth: Works
Touchpad: Works
Graphics: Works (shows tearing)
Touchscreen: Works        
Webcam: Not working
Fn buttons: Partially works
